# my goal is to get the equivalent of the perl6 $/ as result of Parse. 

i don't want to have the pegex in the perl module (or just in a POD?)
because

* i don't need to recompile it, so why should i? 
* i want the pegex to be compiled in js 

so the cli `regex compile` seems ideal in my case.  maybe i'm wrong ? 


based on https://metacpan.org/pod/release/INGY/Pegex-0.25/lib/Pegex/Grammar.pod,
