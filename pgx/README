# my goal is to get the equivalent of the perl6 $/ as result of Parse. 

i don't want to have the pegex in the perl module (or just in a POD?)
because

* i don't need to recompile it, so why should i? 
* i want the pegex to be compiled in js 

so the cli `regex compile` seems ideal in my case.  maybe i'm wrong ? 


based on https://metacpan.org/pod/release/INGY/Pegex-0.25/lib/Pegex/Grammar.pod, 

want to help ? 

    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/eiro/labo &&
        cd labo/pgx &&
        make

[14:12] <vicash> eiro your problem is simple. Look at how I do it in https://github.com/vikasnkumar/vic-pgx Here you will find a Makefile that you can see generates JSON and YAML so your Pegex need not be in Perl
[14:15] <vicash> eiro: another way to do it is have your Pegex be compiled into a grammar into the Perl module itself. that's how I do it in https://github.com/vikasnkumar/vic/blob/master/share/rebuild-grammar . This can be made part of a makefile
[14:16] <vicash> eiro: the rebuild-grammar script was written by ingy. I wrote a rebuild-grammar.PL based on that to be invoked by Build.PL for CPAN to update the grammar before installing.>]'>]>]
