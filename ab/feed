#(2014-01-17T13:24:08+01:00) new (experimental) atom feed

few months ago, i decided to experiment
[make](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/make.html) and
[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) and [git](http://git-scm.com/)
as a minimalistic blog/wiki engine ([werc](http://werc.cat-v.org/) was on my
list too) to replace jekyll (i was a fan of ruby until i tried it).

now i'm totally happy with the basics and i need to extend:

* comment posts via sending an email to the list
* see comments by viewing archives
* a simple way to maintain feeds. i wrote a little perl script to test it
