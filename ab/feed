#(2014-01-18T22:08:52+01:00) atom bomb first test

i decided to push a repository on github with all those tests and notes that
can maybe become a project some day and named it
[labo](https://github.com/eiro/labo/).

this feed is generated with 
[atom bomb](https://github.com/eiro/labo/blob/master/ab/ab.pl) and the
[feed file](https://github.com/eiro/labo/blob/master/ab/feed) i just maintain
manually with vim and [simple zsh helper](https://github.com/eiro/labo/blob/master/ab/zsh)
to create headers.

atom bomb (i'm not sure about the name) is written in
[perl5](http://www.perl.org/) and [Eirotic.pm](https://github.com/eiro/p5-eirotic)
(not released yet because dzil don't want :)), which replace my common boilerplate:

* [Perlude](https://metacpan.org/release/perlude)
* [Method::Signatures](https://metacpan.org/pod/Method::Signatures)
* perl 5.14 with strictures
* YAML

markdown conversion is made by [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). 

#(2014-01-17T13:24:08+01:00) new (experimental) atom feed

few months ago, i decided to experiment
[make](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/make.html) and
[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) and [git](http://git-scm.com/)
as a minimalistic blog/wiki engine ([werc](http://werc.cat-v.org/) was on my
list too) to replace jekyll (i was a fan of ruby until i tried it).

now i'm totally happy with the basics and i need to extend:

* comment posts via sending an email to the list
* see comments by viewing archives
* a simple way to maintain feeds. i wrote a little perl script to test it
